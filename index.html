      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4>What is SWARM?</h4>
      <hr>

      <p>SWARM is The South Wales Additive and Rapid Manufacturing Consortia. It is here to help the NHS source and supply items it critically needs to address Covid-19. SWARM is an initiative to help industry meet the demands of the primary supply chain and to pass intelligence to the NHS about supplies, materials and ideas that industry, manufacturing and design might have, that could help their efforts.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Can I order supplies through SWARM?</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>No. We only educate the supply chain as to the need and match that need with an offer.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>What does SWARM do?</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>We match needs to offers and then provide business intelligence to industry, healthcare workers and procurement teams.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Why should I not just offer my resource or service directly to the NHS or other healthcare organisation?</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>If you want to approach NHS Wales nationally you should visit the Life Science Hub and register your details there. <a href="https://lshubwales.com/call-industry-collaboration-fight-coronavirus">https://lshubwales.com/call-industry-collaboration-fight-coronavirus</a>. If you are not already an NHS Wales or other healthcare organisation approved supplier, you may find it difficult to offer help directly to the hospitals or other organisations. You may have problems providing help, because of established rules. There are well established crisis and safety protocols to protect patients and staff. Making direct offers to help, however well intentioned, can overwhelm staff and procurement teams at a time when they are managing a crisis. We are here to provide a summary of offers to the teams when they are best placed to use them and share information about specific needs with the rest of the industry community too.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>What does SWARM aim to do?</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>SWARM aims to:<br /> &bull; respond to health board&rsquo;s Covid-19 strategies by rapidly gathering information on the availability of needed equipment to feed into the regional supply chain.<br /> &bull; organise the local manufacturing and design expertise to respond to requests for novel design solutions needed ahead of the supply chain.<br /> &bull; organise a volunteer effort to support both the health board&rsquo;s needs and frontline services that lie outside the health board&rsquo;s remit (care homes etc).<br /> &bull; convey information gained to the health boards in an efficient and timely way that supports and does not disrupt existing supply chains.</p>
      <p>SWARM gathers information about available capacity, materials, products and knowledge from the industry, manufacturing and design communities in response to specific needs identified by the frontline health service community.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4> I&rsquo;m a healthcare worker and I need something desperately, how can I use SWARM?</h4>
      <hr>
      <ol>
      <li>Query your Existing Supply chain or manager for a lead time</li>
      <li>If there is no Existing Supply, use SWARM to help your procurement team identify Alternative Supply by filling in a needs request</li>
      <li>If there is no Alternative Supply, we then can use rapid or repurposed manufacturing to create Alternative Supply</li>
      <li>If we can&rsquo;t identify Alternative Supply then we make a request via a Design Challenge</li>
      </ol>
